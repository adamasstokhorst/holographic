*by Adamas Aqsa Fahreza and Martianus Frederic Ezerman.*

Toolkit to perform holographic sensing simulation over stochastic data.

These algorithms were based on and used to obtain simulated results in the following papers:

> A.M. Bruckstein, M.F. Ezerman, A.A. Fahreza, and S. Ling, "Holographic image sensing." Available at (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.03314)

These scripts require `Python 2.7` with the packages `numpy` and `PIL`.

Examples of its usage can be found in the `scripts/` directory. However, to run the plotting scripts, the package `matplotlib` is required.
